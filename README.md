## Residential Real Estate Investment Athens Greece using Machine Learning
This project explores Investment opportunities in the Residential Real Estate Market of Athens Greece. Since there are no established real estate databases, the first phase of the project is to scrape the data from various real estate websites. Specifically, we collected data from more than 50 municipalities in the Athens-Center region. After the data collection is complete, the second phase of the project is to establish a model, using machine learning, that predicts house valuations by initially classifying homes based on their particular characteristics and predicting their expected sales price.
