## Residential Real Estate Investment Athens Greece using Machine Learning
This project is part of a case study whose purpose is to explore Investment opportunities in the Residential Real Estate Market of Athens Greece. Since there are no established databases or websites with API capabilities, the first phase of the project is to scrape the data from various real estate websites where individuals and real estate agencies list properties for sale and for rent.  Specifically, we collected data from more than 50 municipalities in the Athens-Center region. After the data collection is complete, the second phase of the project focuses on interactive visualizations of the data and developing a DNN (Deep Neural Network) model that help us make more informed decisions. The model is divided into three sub models: The first one is trained to classify a house as overvalued/fairly valued or undervalued, based on the Price/Rent ratio, the second model  predicts house prices based on numerical and categorical variables, and the third model conducts the same classification as the first model, but now taking the predicted prices of the second model instead of the actual prices given in the original data Frame.
